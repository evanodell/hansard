# hansard: Accessing Westminster Parliament Data

An R package to automatically fetch data from the UK Parliament API. Ironically, Hansard data is not yet accessible through the API. To explore all available data see <http://www.data.parliament.uk/>. Help on the API itself is here: <http://api.data.parliament.uk/help/>. 

Like the UK parliament API, this package is a work in progress. Additional functionalities will be added to the package as they are developed in the API.

To install from CRAN (version 0.2.5) run:

```
install.packages("hansard")
```


To install the development version (version 0.3.2) run:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvanOdell/hansard")
```
