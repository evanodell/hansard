# hansard: Accessing Westminster Parliament Data

An R package to automatically fetch data from the UK parliament data API. Ironically, Hansard data is not yet accessible through the API. To explore all available data see http://explore.data.parliament.uk/. Help on the API is here: http://api.data.parliament.uk/help. 

The functions are works in progress. They can download all available data in each category, but I have not yet added functionality to accept queries.

To install run `devtools::install_github("EvanOdell/hansard")`
