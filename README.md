# hansard: Accessing Westminster Parliament Data

An R package to automatically fetch data from the UK Parliament API. Ironically, Hansard data is not yet accessible through the API. To explore all available data see http://explore.data.parliament.uk/. Help on the API itself is here: http://api.data.parliament.uk/help. 

Like the UK parliament API, this package is a work in progress. Additional functionalities will be added to the package as they are developed in the API.

To install the development version run:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvanOdell/hansard")
```
