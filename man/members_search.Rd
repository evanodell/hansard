members_search(search = NULL, tidy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{search}{Accepts any string. Defaults to NULL. If NULL, returns a data frame with all members of both houses of parliament.}

\item{tidy}{Fix the variable names in the data frame to remove extra characters, superfluous text and convert variable names to snake_case. For the `members_search` function it also changes the 'about' column name to 'mnis_id', and removes the URL to preserve only the numerical ID. Defaults to TRUE.}
