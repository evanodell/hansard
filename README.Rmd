An R package to automatically fetch data from the UK Parliament API. Ironically, Hansard data is not yet accessible through the API. To explore all available data see <http://www.data.parliament.uk/>. Help on the API itself is here: <http://api.data.parliament.uk/help/>. 

Like the UK parliament API, this package is a work in progress. Additional functionalities will be added to the package as they are developed in the API. The most up-to-date documentation for this package will always be available at <http://evanodell.com/hansard/>.

To install from CRAN (version 0.4.0) run:

```
install.packages("hansard")
```

To install the development version run:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvanOdell/hansard")
```

## Using hansard

For an introduction to `hansard`, the vignette `vignette("introduction", package = "hansard")` is the best place to start. If you are unfamiliar with APIs [https://zapier.com/learn/apis/](this introductory course) is a helpful introduction.

#### API calls with console input

Previous versions (<=0.3.4) of `hansard` included options for console-based inputs to call data and interact with the API. This feature has been removed from subsequent versions, and is available in the [https://github.com/EvanOdell/hansard-console](`hansardconsole`) package. There are no plans to submit this to CRAN, and it is not being actively maintained.
