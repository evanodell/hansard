An R package to automatically fetch data from the UK Parliament API. Ironically, Hansard data (as in speeches) is not yet accessible through the API. To explore all available data see <http://www.data.parliament.uk/>. Documentation for the API itself is available [here](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/).

Like the UK parliament API, this package is a work in progress. Additional functionalities will be added to the package as they are developed in the API. The most up-to-date documentation for this package will always be available at <https://docs.evanodell.com/hansard/>.

To install from CRAN run:

```
install.packages("hansard")
```

To install the development version run:

```
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("evanodell/hansard")
```

## Using hansard

For an introduction to `hansard`, please see the [vignette](https://docs.evanodell.com/hansard/articles/introduction.html). If you are unfamiliar with web APIs [this introductory course](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/) is useful.
